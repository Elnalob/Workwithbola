So you finally launched your website.\
The design looks good, the colors pop, and you even got some compliments.

But no one’s buying. No calls. No messages. Just vibes.

Here’s what’s really going on.\
People don’t trust it.

It’s not personal. It’s just that trust isn’t built on nice fonts and stock photos. It’s built on how real and ready your site feels.

Let’s talk about what might be making people bounce.

### 1. You’re using a free email address

That Gmail address might’ve worked in 2012, but now it makes your business feel unready.\
Get something like [hello@yourbusiness.com](<>). It’s a small move that changes how people see you.

### 2. There’s no proof you’ve helped anyone

You say you’re good at what you do, but where’s the evidence?\
People want to see reviews, testimonials, screenshots. Even one “I loved working with \[your name]” can go a long way.

### 3. You sound like a company brochure

If your site says things like “We are passionate about delivering excellence,” that’s corporate-speak.\
Talk like a human. Say what you do. Say who it’s for. Let people feel like you’re speaking to them, not reading from a PowerPoint.

### 4. Stuff isn’t working

Dead links, broken buttons, outdated forms. These little things are big red flags.\
When your site doesn’t work, people assume your business doesn’t either.

### 5. It just feels off

Maybe it’s cluttered. Maybe it looks like it hasn’t been touched in years.\
People pick up on this stuff fast. You don’t need it to be fancy, just clear and clean.

- - -

### Here’s how to fix it

You don’t need a full website overhaul. Just start small.

* Set up a proper email
* Add one or two real testimonials
* Check your links and buttons
* Rewrite your homepage like you’re talking to a friend
* Clean out anything outdated

Trust doesn’t take a miracle. It just takes consistency.
